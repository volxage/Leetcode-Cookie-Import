# Leetcode-Cookie-Import
This small python script uses Selenium (a headless Firefox client) to sign into your Leetcode, generating and storing cookies in your Leetcode-CLI config file. This script uses some basic web-scraping techniques.
The use-case for this program is for users of Leetcode-CLI that are SSH'ed into a server, or for any other Leetcode-CLI user who wouldn't want to manually use a browser to login.
If you choose to use this script, create a directory inside of your Leetcode-CLI configuration folder, and put the python script there. And don't forget to change the user to your Leetcode username!
